# Jarvis - Voice Assistant

A simple Python-based voice assistant that can recognize voice commands and perform tasks like opening applications or websites. Inspired by the AI assistant Jarvis from the Iron Man series, this assistant uses speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to interact with users.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Listens and processes voice commands using `speech_recognition`.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Responds to user inputs with natural speech using `pyttsx3`.
- **Task Automation**:
  - Open Google Chrome.
  - Navigate to YouTube in the browser.
  - Launch Visual Studio Code.
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Provides appropriate feedback for unrecognized or unsupported commands.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Required Python libraries:
  - `speech_recognition`
  - `pyttsx3`
- Optional: Visual Studio Code and Chrome (added for task-specific commands).

Install the required Python packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bu21csem0500301/jarvis-voice-assistant.git
   cd jarvis-voice-assistant
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the assistant:
   ```bash
   python jarvis.py
   ```

4. Use voice commands such as:
   - **"Open Chrome"**: Opens the Chrome browser.
   - **"Open YouTube"**: Opens YouTube in Chrome.
   - **"Open Visual Studio Code"**: Launches Visual Studio Code.
   - **"Exit"**: Ends the session.

## Customization

- Modify the `perform_task` function to add more commands and tasks.
- Adjust the speech rate and volume in the `pyttsx3` initialization for a personalized experience:
  ```python
  engine.setProperty("rate", 150)
  engine.setProperty("volume", 0.9)
  ```

## Known Issues

- Background noise may affect the accuracy of speech recognition.
- Ensure a stable internet connection for speech recognition to work effectively.
- Add the `code` command to your PATH to enable launching Visual Studio Code directly.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request with your improvements.
